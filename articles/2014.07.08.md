# Really need to lose weight
---- 
*325.5 lbs*
Today I weighted in at 325.5 pounds. I have NEVER, I repeat NEVER weighed that much. I plan to make small life changes that I can live with so\to lose weight, gain energy, etc, etc. Some of the employes that I work with started drink a Gallon of water a day. I think that is a achievable goal for me.

At the end of the day and I drank 1/2 a gallon.  

My Goal is to get to 225 pounds before the 2015 ACST Conference.
