This is source for your average ordinary blog.

I was born December, 23rd 1971. That makes me 42 years old.
I have been a software developer since I graduated from Clemson University i 1996. I love 
what tI do and for that reason I am blessed to have never "worked" a day of my life since I
accepted my position at ACS Technologies. 

I did not mention that I am a Christian. Yes, I am more interested in building treasures 
in the next life than this one. Hell SUCKS! It is not where you want to spend eternity. I
am not going to be there and if that concerns you please call or email me.I will drop 
whatever I am doing and try my best to convince you to have the same position.
